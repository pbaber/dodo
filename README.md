# A TUI todo application

### Main points

1. TUI first
  I want to be able to handle my todo list fluidly in a terminal emulator.

2. WebApp second
  I need to be able to interact with my todo list from my phone in at least the most basic of ways.  Adding todos, editing todos and completing todos.

3. CLI least
  Making sure the todos can be interacted with from the command line is useful for general interaction through third party sources like through AI, hotkeys or scripts.  These can be done through the web server backend but it's just nice to be able to do it through cli commands.


### Heavily opinionated

Todo apps are very personal.  This one is for me.  I will make it the best _for me_ so this application will have the features I want, and probably not the features anyone else wants.

If you want a real kitchen sink command line todo application, try [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/).  I haven't used it, but it appears to be the preeminent todo application for the terminal.
